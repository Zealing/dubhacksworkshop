Project: transfering images into recipes and listing their calories etc.
In this project, we tried to create a simple way to find food and recipe information
given an image of the food. For simplicity, we trained the classifier on a limited
number of foods including: pie, durian, bananas, and lychee. The user can input 
an image of the food and the service will find recipies for it.

Technology we use: 
	1. clarifai's tagging API to tage the name of an image
	2. Recipie Search and Diet from edemam.com which listing recipies and their detail information after entering the food name
